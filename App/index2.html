<p>This is a guide on how you edit the host-file in order to map a domain to an ip-address.</p>

<p>When you type in a domain name, such as <a href="http://www.timflach.com/">www.timflach.com</a>, you are actually being redirected to an IP-address. Around the world there are important computers that know what IP-address is mapped to what domain name. These are called DNS servers. They are updated when a domain name gets moved and real autorities on where web sites are located.</p>

<p>But, before your browser travels out into the world to collect information from the DNS servers it actually asks someone else. Or rather, it looks in your host file.</p>

<p>The host file is located in c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts (on Unix, /etc/hosts) and can contain information on where domain names lead. In it you can add pairs of domain names &lt;&ndash;> IP-adresses to say that if a user types a specific domain name, the browser should be redirected to a particular IP. For example you can add the IP
50.112.105.59 to the domain minecraft.net.</p>

<h3>Here is how you edit the host file!</h3>
